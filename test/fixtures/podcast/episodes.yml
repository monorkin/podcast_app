    <p>Recently 37signals co-founders David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried found themselves at the center of an unexpected internet storm. It all began when David made a significant announcement: Turbo 8 would no longer be using TypeScript. </p><p>What followed was a whirlwind of controversy and social media fireworks.  </p><p><br></p><p>In today's discussion, Kimberly Rhodes sits down with Jason and David to unpack the impact of social media on these types of discussions and the broader implications of these online controversies on open source contributions. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pHIh3dYfoGk">Check out the full video episode on YouTube</a></p><p><br></p><p>Show Notes: </p><p>[00:00] - Kimberly opens up the discussion, sharing the recent announcement made by David, that Turbo 8 would no longer utilize TypeScript and the resulting online controversy.</p><p>[00:33] - Jason shares his reaction to the drama unfolding and offers kudos to David for handling the storm with grace.</p><p>[01:34] - David shares how it all began with eternal debate: dynamic vs. static languages, strong vs. weak typing, and 37signals is firmly in the dynamic, free-spirited camp.</p><p>[02:23] - What led to the BIG decision to pull the TypeScript plug?</p><p>[03:19] - Dynamic vs. static, it's like arguing about your favorite pizza topping. </p><p>[04:13] - TypeScript was removed in record time (freeing the code!).</p><p>[04:59] - This debate is like a merry-go-round of arguments (and we're not here to convert anyone). </p><p>[05:48] - David shares: "People have preconceived notions about my opinions, and when we go against the flow, it's bound to stir the pot," (remember the <a href="https://37signals.com/podcast/leaving-the-cloud/">cloud exit</a>?).</p><p>[07:32] - Programmers can turn small details into raging infernos and social media is like a dry brush waiting for a spark. </p><p>[08:45] - Compared to <a href="https://37signals.com/podcast/pick-a-fight/">fighting Apple</a> for <a href="https://www.hey.com/world/">HEY.com</a> or navigating the minefield of <a href="https://37signals.com/podcast/listener-questions-part-3/">workplace politics</a>, this is just a minor skirmish. </p><p>[10:38] - Humans naturally tend to form tribes and defend their beliefs, but internet drama usually loses its fervor in 24-36 hours.</p><p>[11:38] - Jason shares the binary nature of most debates such as air-cooled vs. water-cooled Porsches or car collectors' preferences.</p><p>[12:25] - Kimberly comments on the polarized nature of the comments.</p><p>[12:38] - There is value in discussing ideas so long as the debates don’t devolve into personal attacks.</p><p>[14:39] - How personal attacks gain traction.</p><p>[15:44] - The importance of embracing diversity in programming languages and techniques for a more vibrant tech world.</p><p>[17:24] - David shares insight from his recent trip to Japan and the beauty of appreciating different cultures without feeling the need for uniformity. </p><p>[18:42] - David reveals whether this unexpected negativity has changed his view of open source and sharing. </p><p>[20:40] - David will continue to contribute to open source BUT…</p><p>[21:26] - Please don’t spoil open source contributions for everyone else. </p><p>[23:16] - David shares a surprising recurring theme in the Rework podcast and why it’s important to speak out about your beliefs—especially those you are hesitant to voice publicly. </p><p>[24:01] - David discusses whether this kerfuffle has had any effect on the 37signals team. </p><p>[25:19] - Rework is a production <a href="https://37signals.com/">37signals</a>.

    <p>Picture this: a dimly lit room where velvet-robed figures gather in secret to make decisions of paramount importance as the fate of the pitches for the next product development cycle hangs in the balance. </p><p><br></p><p>The "betting table” – where the formalized pitches for each six-week work cycle are selected – might seem mysterious but we're about to unravel its secrets. </p><p>Listen in as host Kimberly Rhodes sits down with 37signals co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson to explore the unique inner workings of the "betting table" and how this process shapes each product development cycle.</p><p><br></p><p>Tune in to discover 37signals' approach to selecting and refining projects at the "betting table."</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/k-Kn-BGaDo4">Check out the full video episode on YouTube</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Show Notes: <br></strong><br></p><p>[00:00] - Today on the podcast, the discussion focuses on the betting table and how the decisions are made about which pitches are selected and which projects to schedule.</p><p>[00:42] - Jason shares what the betting table is. </p><p>[02:26] - The betting table process: refining pitches into a kickoff document.</p><p>[03:17] - David shares the background behind the betting table and how it has evolved. </p><p>[05:51] - The betting table: passionately advocating for different views, with one person ultimately making the decision.</p><p>[06:51] - Ensuring that resource allocation decisions are made efficiently while avoiding committee-driven decision-making.</p><p>[08:56] - Decisions made at the betting table can sometimes be passed to others who are more passionate or informed about a particular project.</p><p>[10:04] - It's all about timing—unselected pitches don't automatically get another chance in the next cycle, but if they are relevant, they might.  <br>[10:51] - Jason shares his biggest issue with backlogs. </p><p>[11:33] - David shares why Shape Up is such a powerful way of working and how the betting table process provides multiple opportunities to influence product direction.</p><p>[14:38] - Jason shares how the assignment of team members works during the betting table to ensure that the available resources match the selected projects.</p><p>[15:49] - David shares the background behind aligning pitch budgets with available resources and calendars during the betting table.</p><p>[19:55] - Why so much of the betting table process is asynchronous and done via written communication,</p><p>[22:54] - When calls might need to happen during the betting table process. </p><p>[23:57] - For more background on how 37signals manages product development, get your free copy of the book <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/shapeup"><em>Shape Up</em></a>.
